Access the application [here](https://gamergoal.net/rateflix/index.php).

Search for any movie and immediately view the relevant RottenTomatoes, IMDB and Metacritic scores. The app has its own score system too, and you can add to it by making an account and submiting your own rating. 
Movies without any Rateflix ratings will have a score of 100% by default. You can see the changes you make to a score by refreshing the search query. 

Movie data is provided by the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
